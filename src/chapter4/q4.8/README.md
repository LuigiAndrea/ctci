## First Common Ancestor 

##### Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. NOTE: This is not necessarily a binary search tree. (Lowest Common Ancestor - allowed a node to be a descendant of itself)
