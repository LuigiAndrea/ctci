## Boolean Evaluation
#### Given a boolean expression consisting of the symbols 0 (false), 1 (true), & (AND), I (OR), and /\ (XOR), and a desired boolean result value result, implement a function to count the number of ways of parenthesizing the expression such that it evaluates to result. The expression should be full parenthesized (e.g.,(0)^(1)) but not extraneously (e.g.,(((0))^((1))).
